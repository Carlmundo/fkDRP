DISCORD RICH PRESENCE
=====================

This tree contains the DRP (Discord Rich Presence) source code, which
aims to ingrate SPV3.2 with Discord by allowing players to display the
campaign mission & difficulty they're playing on.

The source code has been generously developed and provided by giraffe,
and has been integrated into a custom Visual C++ project for convenient
reproducible builds.
